# SASS
SASS is a CSS preProcessor, a tool used to extend the basic functionality of default vanilla CSS. It helps us to use complex logical syntax like variables, functions, code nesting and so much more. We now can deal with a lot of limitations and difficulty in code maintenance and scalability caused by CSS.
